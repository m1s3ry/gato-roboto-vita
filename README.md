Patch to make Gato Roboto playable on the PS Vita
###

## Disclaimer
This patch does not contain any game files from Gato Roboto. **You need the game files from your legally owned copy**.
If you don't have a copy of the game, you can buy it [HERE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/916730/Gato_Roboto/)
It **WILL NOT WORK* with an illegal copy of the game due to hash check. ALWAYS support indie devs.

## Instructions (Read them carefully)
1. Download the VPK and install it on your hacked PS Vita
2. In your PC, open the folder where Gato Roboto is installed (Steam -> Right-click on the game -> Manage -> Browse Local Files)
3. Download the patch and extract it in that folder. After that, run `apply_patch.bat`.
4. If everything went correctly, a `Patched_Files` folder will be created with various files, including a `game.win`.
5. Copy the entire contents of `Patched_Files` to `ux0:app/GATOROBOT/games`. Overwrite when prompted. 
6. Optional but HIGHLY recommended: Overclock CPU to 500mhz with PSVShell.

**IMPORTANT:** This patch will only work with the Steam build v4120259. The data.win MD5 hash should be `38970c275305ccd7c9abe9a10817872e`.

## Known Problems
* Most of the palette swaps don't work (black screen).
* A few areas have performance problems (the biggest rooms mainly).
* Key remapping is disabled.
* Music and SFX sliders affect all sound files.
